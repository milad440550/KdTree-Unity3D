<h1>K-D TREE Algorithm with Unity-3D</h1>

In this project, I have used K-D tree data structure to search and find 
nearest object in the list of Asteroids for Asteroids object and draw a red line between them.

<h3>What is k-d tree? </h3> 
<p>In computer science, a k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) 
is a space-partitioning data structure for organising points in a k-dimensional space.
k-d trees are a useful data structure for several applications, such as searches involving a
multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbour searches).
k-d trees are a special case of binary space partitioning trees.</p>
